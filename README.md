❤️ Expert System for Predicting Heart Disease
📌 Project Overview

This project is an Expert System designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease using Machine Learning (ML) and rule-based inference. The system combines a knowledge base, inference engine, and user interface to analyze patient health data and provide accurate predictions that support medical decision-making.

By leveraging ML algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), the system classifies patients into different risk categories and provides insights to help doctors and patients take preventive measures.

🎯 Objectives

Predict heart disease risk based on patient attributes.

Provide decision-support for physicians, not a replacement for them.

Improve healthcare outcomes by identifying high-risk patients early.

Demonstrate the application of AI and expert systems in cardiology.


🛠️ Methodology
🔹 Dataset

Framingham Heart Study dataset (from Kaggle).

Includes attributes such as age, gender, cholesterol, blood pressure, BMI, smoking status, and diabetes.

Preprocessing steps:

Handling missing values (mean imputation).

Label encoding for categorical variables.

Standardization of numerical attributes.

🔹 Machine Learning Models

Logistic Regression – Binary classification of heart disease risk.

Random Forest Classifier – Ensemble of decision trees for robust predictions.

Support Vector Machines (SVM) – With linear and RBF kernels for classification.

🔹 System Components

Knowledge Base – Patient data & risk rules.

Inference Engine – Rule-based reasoning + ML predictions.

User Interface – Simple interface for interaction and results display.


📊 Results

Accuracy of prediction: ~80% on test dataset.

Patients categorized into Low, Medium, and High-risk groups.

Supports early intervention by highlighting high-risk individuals.
